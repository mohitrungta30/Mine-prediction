# Mine-prediction
Basic machine learning model to predict mine using SONAR 
sonar.csv is the dataset required for the machine learning model to work
run the code along with the dataset present to train and test the model.
Once the process is complete we can predict mine for any dataset by manually putting the value in the code.
